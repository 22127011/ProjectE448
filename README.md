# ProjectE448
Most of the work done for my final year Electrical and Electronics Robotics project

This project aims to develop a virtual running pacesetter system for road and cross-country
running. The developed system consists of a recorder which records the running route,
a pace planner which plans the paces over the entire route before the run starts and a
virtual runner which is a visualisation of the pacesetterâ€™s location for a human runner to
follow in real time.
Practical tests were performed to verify that the system performs all its requirements.
The test results show that the GPS sensor is reliable, the pace planner segments the route
and adjust paces as a function of elevation, the virtual runner enables a human runner to
follow it and finish a run in their desired completion time while getting indications of
whether they are on pace or not.
The developed virtual running pacesetter system enables a human runner to run
more optimally paced runs.
